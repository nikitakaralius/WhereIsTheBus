# Where Is The Bus

<br />
This application is designed to provide structured information about bus schedules in Izhevsk using Telegram Bot.

## The reason

As a student, I use public transport a lot. However, I was tired of crowds on the buses.
Therefore, we need a service that will help us understand the trend of bus arrivals
according to the bus stop we have chosen.
Having this information, we can easily skip one transport and wait for another.
With fewer people, with more comfort, without being late.

## Better approach

We use the [existing system](https://igis.ru/gortrans/), which provides such information for us.
Why don't we use this solution?
Well, there are a lot of mistakes in that software:

* The site instead of the app (Their app doesn't work)
* Unstructured information
* Each route placed on its own page
* Information is often inaccurate
* No notifications at all

Is it comfortable to use such a system? Nobody will search through the site for their routes.
<br />

Our approach is to send you this information whenever you want using Telegram Bot. <br />
Why it's better?

* No app required (only Telegram)
* Structured information for bus stop you have chosen
* Notification scheduling
* It's faster

## Development plans

Since the [system](https://igis.ru/gortrans/) has information about the cities of the Udmurt Republic and other modes of transport,
our service may provide this information in the future. Stay tuned ðŸšŽ.
